# EmotionDetectionAndPrediction

Hello! This project was made by Zainab Zahid (zainab.zahid2002@gmail.com) and myself, Muhammad Osama (mohammad.osama50@gmail.com)

5th Semester Emotion Detection and Prediction project for the course of Digital Image Processing. All the code is in MATLAB. 

Since the code of this project is crucial to our FYP, we are opting not to include the code, but it will be made available to anyone who seeks our permission to use our code and emails us. 

Our project takes live input from the webcam and accurately detects emotions with upto 95% testing accuracy and predicts emotions with upto 63.14% accuracy (15 seconds into the future).
